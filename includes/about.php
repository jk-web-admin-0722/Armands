   <strong> Computer programs make computers work</strong><p>
Computer programs (or software) are what makes computers work. Without software, modern computers are just complicated machines for turning electricity into heat. It’s software on your computer that runs your operating system, browser, email, games, movie player – just about everything.

With the right skills and experience, a programmer can craft software to solve an unlimited number of problems – from telling you when your next train will arrive at playing your favourite music.

The possibilities are constrained only by your imagination. That’s why I love programming.Computer programs make computers work
